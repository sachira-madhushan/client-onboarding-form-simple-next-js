<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sachira-madhushan/client-onboarding-form-simple-next-js/refs/heads/feature/client-onboarding-form/public/application.gif">


A small client onboarding form built with **Next.js App Router**, **React Hook Form**, and **Zod** validation.  
The form validates user input, posts the data to an external API endpoint, and provides a smooth UX with inline errors, disabled submit during submission, and success/error feedback.
